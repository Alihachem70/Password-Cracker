# Brute Force Password Cracker

## Overview

This Python script is a simple brute force password cracker designed to crack passwords by generating random guesses. It simulates a basic brute force attack by repeatedly generating random passwords until it matches the input password.

## How It Works

The password cracker generates random passwords consisting of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits. It continues generating passwords until it finds a match with the input password. The number of attempts made before finding the correct password is recorded and displayed to the user.
